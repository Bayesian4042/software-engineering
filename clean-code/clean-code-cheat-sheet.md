"Clean code always looks like it was written by someone who cares."
â€“ Michael Feathers

# Principles of Clean Code
## Readable Code
    - Use meaningful and pronounceable variable names.
    - Write short and focused functions.
    - Use proper indentation and spacing.
    - Consistent Naming Conventions
    - Use camelCase for variables and functions.
    - Use PascalCase for classes and interfaces.
    - Keep naming consistent throughout the codebase.

## Commenting and Documentation
    - Document public APIs and major modules.
    - Avoid hard-coded strings; use constants or configuration files.

## Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
    - Each function or class should have one responsibility.
    - Refactor code that tries to do too much.
    - DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)
    - Avoid duplicate code by creating reusable functions and modules.
    - Use inheritance and polymorphism where appropriate.

## KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)
    - Simplify complex logic.
    - Avoid over-engineering solutions.

## YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It)
    - Do not add functionality until it is necessary.
    - Focus on current requirements, not future possibilities.

## Proper Error Handling
    - Use exceptions instead of returning error codes.
    - Catch specific exceptions and handle them appropriately.

## Refactoring
    - Regularly refactor code to improve its structure.
    - Remove dead code and redundant comments.

## Best Practices
    - Code Reviews: Regularly review code with peers to catch mistakes and improve quality.
    - Unit Testing: Write tests to ensure code correctness and to catch regressions.
    - Continuous Integration: Integrate code changes frequently and run automated tests.
    - Version Control: Use version control systems like Git to manage code changes and collaborate effectively.
    - Modular Design: Break down the system into modules to make it easier to understand, test, and maintain.
    - Code Formatting Tools: Use tools like Prettier or ESLint to maintain consistent code style.
