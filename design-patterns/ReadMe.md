# What are design patterns?
- Design patterns are well-tested, reusable solutions. They are solution templates for how to solve common software engineering problems.

# Why to use them
- Design patterns are associated with good, well organized software design. As a developer we are prone to mistakes and sometimes inexperienced decisions. Think of design patterns as a bag of reusable experience form many generations of coders and Software Engineers, that we get to learn from.

# Most crucial design patterns:
- Creational Design Pattern (Deals with ways of creating objects): 
    - Singleton
    - Factory Method
    - Builder pattern
- Structural (Deals with ways of managing complex objects hirerachies): 
    - Adaptor pattern
- Behaviour (Deals with ways of identifying and improving object messaging): 
    - Stratgey pattern
    - Observer pattern
    - State pattern

once you master these patterns, you will see the world of coding differently. 

# Why do we need software architecture?
  ## Complex software system are plagued with many issues:
    - Timelines are streteched because of changing requirements.
    - Multiple developers have hard time coordinating their efforts.
    - Often there is code redundancy and poor documentation.
  This creates issues with maintenance and overall flexibility of adding new features. 
  One answer to overall cited problems is having a proper design and architecture.

# Why use UML?
- UML is good tool to document something as well defined as Design Patterns. UML communicates design pattern structure very well. 
    - class Diagram
    - sequence diagrma

# Difference between organized and unorganized code?
