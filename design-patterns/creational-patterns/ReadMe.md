# Patterns

## Prototype Pattern
A fully initialized instance to be copied or cloned.
Example: Chess game -> initial setup can be stored as a prototype. when someone creates new game, we can clone this. 

## Builder Pattern
Separates object construction from its representation. hides complex internal structure. 
Example: chess game -> objects like bishop, Pawn can be separated.

## Singleton Pattern
A class of which only single instance can exist.
For example: chess game -> King is singleton. -> only one instance. 

- difficult to unit test
- In spring, all beans are singleton

## Factory Pattern
