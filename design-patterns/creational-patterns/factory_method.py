"""
Define an interface for creating an object, but let subclasses decide which class to instantiate. 
Factory Method lets a class defer instantiation to subclasses.

When to use:
When a caller can't anticipate the types of objects it must create.
When you have many objects of common type. 

Two variants:
1. Parameterized Factory Method
2. Classic GoF
